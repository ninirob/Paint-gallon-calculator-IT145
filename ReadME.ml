## 📝 Overview
This is a simple Java program that calculates how many gallons of paint are needed to paint a wall based on user input for wall height and width. It also calculates how many cans of paint are required, rounding up to the nearest whole can.

## 💻 How it works:
1. The program asks for the wall height and width.
2. It calculates the area of the wall.
3. It computes how many gallons of paint are needed (based on 350 square feet per gallon).
4. It calculates and displays how many cans of paint are required (rounded up).

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Java** 🟩
- **Scanner class** for user input 📥
- **Math.ceil** to round up the number of cans needed 🧑‍🔧

## 📚 Instructions
1. Run the program 💻
2. Enter the height and width of the wall 🏠
3. Get the paint required 🎨 and number of cans needed 🛒
